    <h2>Finch (2014&ndash;present)</h2>

    <p class="bump-out milli">
        Node.js, MongoDB, Redis, RabbitMQ, React, Flux, NW.js
        <span class="split-before"></span><a href="https://meetfinch.com">meetfinch.com</a>
    </p>

    <p>My flagship project; &lsquo;Software as a Service&rsquo; product allowing
    secure, instant previews of local websites on any internet connected device.
    Finch was born out of the frustration of not being able to preview
    development websites on real mobile &amp; tablet devices at a number of
    companies I&rsquo;ve worked with in recent years. After initially prototyping a
    solution in 2013 I spent the first quarter of 2014 turning the prototype into a product.</p>

    <p>That product comprises of the website itself, a Node.JS command-line application
    and a desktop application written using React, Flux and NW.js. Despite the increase in
    scope of the project and scale of the customer base over the years the application is
    still managed entirely by myself.</p>

    <h2>Crimson Digital&mdash;Director (2015&mdash;present)</h2>

    <p class="bump-out milli">
        Node.js, React, Flux, MySQL, Redis
    </p>

    <p>One half of Crimson Digital Ltd involved in the planning, development and running
    of a 24/7, heavily trafficked SPA website. This system involved a free-to-play online
    game which attracted a huge amount of visitors from all around the world and as such
    required a rock-solid infrastructure and a unique, captivating game style. One of the
    most fast-paced and intense projects to date which ran for 6 months during 2015.</p>

    <h2>Valtech&mdash;Software Engineer (2014&ndash;2015)</h2>

    <p class="bump-out milli">
        Duration: 14 months
        <span class="split-before">
            PHP, TDD, JavaScript, CI
        </span>
    </p>

    <p>A year-long contract working on a high profile Government contract in Leeds. Although
    predominantly a PHP role, over time I became the principle architect, developer and maintainer
    of the frontend JavaScript module system, as well as the frontend build pipeline (involving
    CSS and images alongside JavaScript).</p>

    <h2>Sky Sports&mdash;JavaScript Developer (2013)</h2>

    <p class="bump-out milli">
        Duration: 6 months
        <span class="split-before">
            JavaScript
        </span>
    </p>

    <p>A six month contract for <a href="http://www.skysports.com/">Sky Sports</a>
    working as part of an Agile team architecting &amp; implementing a responsive
    website&mdash;also set to double up as a replacement to several native apps
    upon launch&mdash;for one of the brand&rsquo;s flagship products. The app-heavy
    focus of the project led to the site being developed as a
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application">Single-page application</a>
    using <a href="http://angularjs.org/">AngularJS</a>.</p>

    <h2>Retail website rebuild* (2012&ndash;2013)</h2>

    <p class="bump-out milli">
        Duration: 3 months
        <span class="split-before">
            PHP5, CI, TDD, JavaScript, LAMP, MySQL, Redis
        </span>
    </p>

    <p>This project involved a full rewrite of a national retailer&rsquo;s
    website, in which I was employed as the sole backend developer. In additition,
    all frontend JavaScript was my responsibility.
    To ensure the utmost quality of the build over
    1,500 automated tests were written over the course of the project: both
    unit tests and full-stack scenarios, the latter of which amount to over
    7,000 lines of tests written in <a href="http://coffeescript.org/">CoffeeScript</a>
    and run using <a href="http://zombie.labnotes.org/">ZombieJS</a>. All tests
    are run through my
    Continuous Integration server&mdash;which also manages the automated
    release process to both the test and the live, load-balanced cluster. The backend
    architecture is a fairly typical LAMP stack except for the use of
    <a href="http://redis.io/">Redis</a> a session storage mechanism and key-value
    cache store.</p>

    <p>The <a href="https://github.com/makeusabrew/jaoss">jaoss library</a>
    is an open source MVC PHP5 framework focused on speed and testability. It
    started life in May 2010 and has since been used in the vast majority of projects
    I&rsquo;ve built from quick-turnaround microsites to high-performance
    sites supporting tens of thousands of daily visitors. Although the library
    is a <a href="https://github.com/makeusabrew/jaoss">standalone project</a>
    it is more commonly used as part of the <a href="https://github.com/makeusabrew/jaoss-web-template">jaoss web template</a>
    which includes the library as a

    <h2>Bootbox.js (2011&ndash;present)</h2>

    <p class="bump-out milli">

        <a href="https://github.com/makeusabrew/bootbox">GitHub Repository</a>
        <span class="split-before">JavaScript, CoffeeScript</span>
    </p>

    <p>Originally a small set of wrapper functions written to scratch my own
    itch, <a href="http://bootboxjs.com/">Bootbox</a> has since grown into
    its own standalone JavaScript library with over 1,500 watchers on
    <a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a>. To support an ever-growing
    community of users and developers it has its own comprehensive test suite
    written in CoffeeScript and providing full code coverage. The project follows
    the <a href="http://semver.org/">Semantic Versioning</a> specification and
    is also under Continuous Integration by using
    <a href="https://github.com/metaskills/mocha-phantomjs">mocha-phantomjs</a>
    to run the tests in a &lsquo;headless&rsquo; WebKit browser.</p>

    <h2>Mobile HTML5 app* (2012)</h2>

    <p class="bump-out milli">
        <span class="split-after">Duration: 1 month</span>
        HTML, CSS, JavaScript
    </p>

    <p>Undertaken on behalf of <a href="http://www.madebypi.co.uk/">MadeByPi</a>
    in Leeds, this project involved the development of a dedicated mobile site
    for which I was contracted as the sole frontend developer, meaning my
    remit was HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript (unusually, no PHP!). The brief
    required avoiding pre-existing mobile libraries and as such presented
    numerous challenges involving the creation of a bespoke JavaScript
    library taking care of flyout navigation menus and iOS-style page sliding
    transitions.</p>

    <h2>Payne Digital Website (2011&ndash;present)</h2>

        <span class="split-before">PHP, JavaScript, HTML5, Sass, TDD, CI</span>
    </p>

    <p>This site itself is a reflection of much of the work I do; it is
    <a href="https://github.com/makeusabrew/paynedigital.com">open source</a>,
    built on the <a href="https://github.com/makeusabrew/jaoss">jaoss framework</a>,
    has a comprehensive <a href="https://github.com/makeusabrew/paynedigital.com/tree/master/test">test</a>
    <a href="https://github.com/makeusabrew/paynedigital.com/tree/master/tests">suite</a>
    and is built and automatically deployed via <a href="/search?q=ci">Jenkins CI</a>.
    It employs cutting-edge use of the HTML5 pushState API and CSS3 transitions for
    subtle yet smooth page navigation, works with and without JavaScript and uses
    the <a href="http://sass-lang.com/">Sass</a> CSS preprocessor for the perfect
    blend of
    <a href="https://github.com/makeusabrew/paynedigital.com/tree/master/sass">maintainable stylesheets</a>
    and optimised CSS output. It serves minified and compressed assets for maximum
    bandwidth efficiency and employs
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsive_web_design">responsive design</a>
    to ensure the best experience across mobile, tablet and desktop devices.</p>

    <h2>Faavorite (2012)</h2>

    </p>

    <p>An out-of-hours project built with a friend to satisfy our shared
    desire for a better way of organising, sharing and discovering
    favourited tweets. Ostensibly quite a simple undertaking, the build
    of this project ended up being fairly complicated and involved learning
    a number of design patterns and technologies. I was the sole backend
    and JavaScript developer and <a href="http://faavorite.com">faavorite</a>
    was the first project in which I deployed any <a href="http://nodejs.org/">node.js</a>
    code in production to handle a huge amount of background task processing.

    The project also involved a number of other technologies over and above
    the typical LAMP stack including the use of <a href="http://redis.io/">redis</a>
    as both a news feed and caching mechanism along with ZeroMQ and WebSockets to
    deliver low-latency notifications to users.</p>

    <h2>Flingball iOS (2011)</h2>

        <span class="split-before">Objective C, C++</span>
    </p>

    <p>A summer experiment with game development for iOS
    (both iPhone and iPad). Although the game never saw the light
    of the App Store it yielded a thorough understanding of universal
    iOS development. The project eventually found its way
    <a href="https://github.com/makeusabrew/flingball-ios">onto GitHub</a>
    instead of iTunes.</p>
